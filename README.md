Ansible roles
=============

This repository provide ready to use Ansible roles.

You can treat it like [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/), but in local edition.

It helps me to setup not only servers, but also desktop hosts. That's why, you can see roles for well known daemons, and also for basic packages on a daily basis usage.

This repository contain example:
- host /inventory/ file
- playbooks, where projects have different setup for environment or host

It also contains '_polish' playbook, which can be used to refresh packages and clean system.
